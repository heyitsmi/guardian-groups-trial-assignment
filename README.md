* **Frontend:** Tailwind CSS v4, Alpine.js  
* **Full-Stack Interactivity:** Livewire 3  
* **Admin Panel:** Filament 3  
* **Search:** Laravel Scout \+ Meilisearch

## **üöÄ Local Setup Instructions**

Please follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

* PHP 8.2 or higher  
* Composer  
* Node.js & npm  
* A running instance of **Meilisearch**. (You can download it from the [official website](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/getting_started/installation) or use Docker).  
* A database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

### **Step-by-Step Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   git clone https://github.com/heyitsmi/guardian-groups-trial-assignment  
   cd guardian-groups-trial-assignment

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   composer install  
   npm install

3. **Environment Setup**  
   * Copy the example environment file:  
     cp .env.example .env

   * Open the .env file and configure your database connection (DB\_HOST, DB\_PORT, DB\_DATABASE, DB\_USERNAME, DB\_PASSWORD).  
   * Add the Meilisearch configuration:  
     SCOUT\_DRIVER=meilisearch  
     MEILISEARCH\_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:7700  
     MEILISEARCH\_KEY=masterKey

4. **Generate Application Key**  
   php artisan key:generate

5. **Run Meilisearch**  
   * Make sure your Meilisearch instance is running. If you downloaded the executable, run it in a separate terminal window:  
     .\\meilisearch.exe

6. **Run Migrations and Seeders**  
   * This command will set up the database schema and populate it with sample data (users, groups, badges, missions).  
     php artisan migrate:fresh \--seed

7. **Import Data to Meilisearch**  
   * This command will index your GuardianGroup data so it becomes searchable.  
     php artisan scout:import "App\\Models\\GuardianGroup"

8. **Run the Development Servers**  
   * You'll need two terminal windows for this.  
   * In the first terminal, run the Vite server for frontend assets:  
     npm run dev

   * In the second terminal, run the Laravel development server:  
     php artisan serve

The application should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
